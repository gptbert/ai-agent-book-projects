user_question: The IRS just sent me a notice about $2.8 million in unreported cryptocurrency
  gains, but I thought my husband only had a small Bitcoin investment. What's my actual
  exposure here?
evaluation_criteria: 'The agent must synthesize three conversations to uncover the
  complete cryptocurrency situation:


  Asset Discovery Timeline:

  - 2013: Initial $10,000 Bitcoin investment (100+ BTC at ~$100 each)

  - 2019: Second safe deposit box opened (likely for additional crypto storage)

  - Year before death: Separation begins, asset hiding starts

  - Daily trading until death generating gains

  - Multiple wallets across drives and safe deposit boxes


  Hidden Connections:

  1. Computer repair revealed "Cold Storage", "Wallet Backup", "Keys 2021" drives

  2. Bank revealed TWO safe deposit boxes with likely seed phrases

  3. Divorce mediation revealed active daily trading and asset concealment


  True Crypto Portfolio:

  - Original: 100+ Bitcoin worth $4+ million

  - Multiple wallets (home safe + 2 deposit boxes)

  - Active trading generating substantial gains

  - Son knew about and helped with initial purchase

  - Husband planned to hide from divorce


  Tax Liability Explosion:

  - Hundreds of trades, each taxable event

  - Never reported on joint tax returns

  - Wife has joint liability for tax years filed together

  - $2.8 million IRS notice likely just the beginning

  - Penalties and interest could double the amount


  Legal Complications:

  1. Marital property (bought during marriage from joint account)

  2. Attempted concealment during separation (illegal)

  3. Son''s claim based on promise to hide assets (fraudulent)

  4. Estate now liable for all taxes

  5. Wife personally liable for joint return years


  Documentation Trail:

  - 24-word seed phrase found (one wallet)

  - Multiple drives with wallet backups

  - Two safe deposit boxes with unknown contents

  - Coinbase account (need death certificate access)

  - Computer showing daily trading history


  Financial Exposure:

  - Crypto assets: $4+ million minimum

  - Tax liability: $2.8 million + penalties + interest

  - Potential criminal tax evasion charges

  - Joint filer liability for unreported income

  - Kids'' inheritance claims vs. marital property rights


  The agent must recognize the husband built an extensive crypto portfolio over years,
  actively concealed it during separation, never paid taxes, and left the wife exposed
  to massive tax liability while his kids claim inheritance rights to assets that
  are legally marital property.
