    content: Hi, I need help with my divorce proceedings. Things are getting complicated
      with the asset division
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand this is a difficult time. Let's review your situation. How
      long were you married?
  - role: user
    content: Eighteen years. We separated last February
  - role: assistant
    content: That's a long-term marriage, which affects asset division. Do you have
      children?
  - role: user
    content: Two kids, 16 and 14 years old
  - role: assistant
    content: Custody and support will be important considerations. Is custody being
      contested?
  - role: user
    content: No, we've agreed to joint custody with them primarily living with me
  - role: assistant
    content: That's good when parents can agree. Now, let's discuss assets. Do you
      own a home together?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, we have the house on Riverside Drive, valued at about $650,000
  - role: assistant
    content: What's the remaining mortgage?
  - role: user
    content: About $180,000 left on it
  - role: assistant
    content: So roughly $470,000 in equity. Any other real estate?
  - role: user
    content: We have a rental property on Oak Street, worth maybe $350,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Mortgage on that one?
  - role: user
    content: It's paid off. We bought it ten years ago as an investment
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. What about retirement accounts?
  - role: user
    content: I have a 401k with about $280,000, and my spouse has one with $220,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Were these accumulated during the marriage?
  - role: user
    content: Most of it. I had maybe $30,000 when we got married
  - role: assistant
    content: That premarital portion would typically remain yours. What about other
      investments?
  - role: user
    content: We have a joint brokerage account with about $150,000 in stocks
  - role: assistant
    content: Any other significant assets? Cars, boats, collectibles?
  - role: user
    content: Two cars - mine is worth about $25,000, theirs is worth $35,000. Both
      paid off
  - role: assistant
    content: What about debts beyond the mortgage?
  - role: user
    content: Credit cards with about $12,000 total, and a home equity line with $40,000
      balance
  - role: assistant
    content: Is the HELOC on the primary residence?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, we used it for renovations two years ago
  - role: assistant
    content: Now, has your spouse proposed any division arrangement?
  - role: user
    content: They want to keep the rental property and their retirement account
  - role: assistant
    content: And in exchange?
  - role: user
    content: I'd get the house and my retirement account
  - role: assistant
    content: Let's run the numbers. The rental is worth $350,000, their 401k is $220,000,
      total $570,000
  - role: user
    content: And I'd get the house equity of $470,000 plus my 401k at $280,000, so
      $750,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: Don't forget you'd also assume the mortgage and HELOC, reducing your
      net
  - role: user
    content: Right, so really $530,000 for me after the debts
  - role: assistant
    content: Plus you'd be responsible for the mortgage payments going forward
  - role: user
    content: That doesn't seem fair
  - role: assistant
    content: It's not equitable. What about the brokerage account?
  - role: user
    content: They suggested splitting that 50-50
  - role: assistant
    content: So add $75,000 to each side. You'd have $605,000, they'd have $645,000
  - role: user
    content: Still not equal
  - role: assistant
    content: Plus you'd have all the debt service. We should counter-propose
  - role: user
    content: What would you suggest?
  - role: assistant
    content: 'Option one: Sell both properties and split all proceeds after debts'
  - role: user
    content: I really want to keep the house for the kids' stability
  - role: assistant
    content: 'Understandable. Option two: You keep the house, they get the rental,
      but equalize with other assets'
  - role: user
    content: How would we equalize?
  - role: assistant
    content: They'd owe you about $60,000 from their 401k to make it even
  - role: user
    content: Can you just transfer money from a 401k?
  - role: assistant
    content: Through a QDRO - Qualified Domestic Relations Order. It's a special court
      order for retirement divisions
  - role: user
    content: Does that trigger taxes?
  - role: assistant
    content: Not if done properly through the QDRO. It's a tax-free transfer between
      spouses in divorce
  - role: user
    content: That sounds better
  - role: assistant
    content: Another consideration - who claims the kids on taxes?
  - role: user
    content: We haven't discussed that
  - role: assistant
    content: Typically the primary custodial parent, but it's negotiable. The tax
      benefits are significant
  - role: user
    content: What about child support?
  - role: assistant
    content: With joint custody, it depends on income disparity. What are your respective
      incomes?
  - role: user
    content: I make about $95,000, they make $110,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Not a huge gap, but they'd likely owe some support. State calculator
      suggests about $400 per month per child
  - role: user
    content: So $800 monthly?
  - role: assistant
    content: Approximately, though it could be offset against the asset division
  - role: user
    content: What about alimony?
  - role: assistant
    content: In an 18-year marriage with similar incomes, it's possible but not automatic
  - role: user
    content: I did stay home for five years when the kids were young
  - role: assistant
    content: That career sacrifice could support an alimony claim. Maybe 2-3 years
      of support
  - role: user
    content: How much would that be?
  - role: assistant
    content: Possibly $1,000-1,500 monthly, but it's negotiable
  - role: user
    content: What about health insurance? I'm on their plan
  - role: assistant
    content: You'll need your own after divorce. COBRA allows 36 months continuation
      at your cost
  - role: user
    content: That's expensive
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, often $600-800 monthly. Factor that into negotiations
  - role: user
    content: What about the rental property income?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently that's joint income. How much does it generate?
  - role: user
    content: About $2,400 monthly after expenses
  - role: assistant
    content: If they keep it, they get all that income going forward
  - role: user
    content: That's another advantage for them
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. We should value the rental higher - include the income stream
  - role: user
    content: How do we do that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Commercial properties use cap rates. The $28,800 annual income adds significant
      value
  - role: user
    content: So maybe it's worth more than $350,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: Could argue $400,000 with the income considered
  - role: user
    content: That changes the math significantly
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes. Now they'd be getting $620,000 in value versus your $605,000
  - role: user
    content: Even worse split
  - role: assistant
    content: We need to restructure. What about keeping both properties jointly for
      now?
  - role: user
    content: How would that work?
  - role: assistant
    content: Continue co-owning the rental, split income, sell when market improves
  - role: user
    content: We don't really want to stay financially connected
  - role: assistant
    content: Understandable. Then selling the rental might be best
  - role: user
    content: When would we need to sell?
  - role: assistant
    content: Ideally before the divorce finalizes, or specify a deadline in the decree
  - role: user
    content: The market's pretty good now
  - role: assistant
    content: Then list it soon. Sales take 2-3 months typically
  - role: user
    content: What happens to the rental income meanwhile?
  - role: assistant
    content: Should go into a separate account, split after sale closes
  - role: user
    content: Okay. What about timing for everything else?
  - role: assistant
    content: The QDRO takes 2-3 months after the divorce decree. House refinance about
      the same
  - role: user
    content: Refinance?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'll need to refinance the house into your name only
  - role: user
    content: Will I qualify on my income alone?
  - role: assistant
    content: With $95,000 income and $180,000 mortgage, should be fine. Debt-to-income
      looks good
  - role: user
    content: What about the HELOC?
  - role: assistant
    content: That needs to be rolled into the refinance or paid off
  - role: user
    content: So I'd be refinancing $220,000 total?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes. At current rates, probably $1,600-1,800 monthly payment
  - role: user
    content: That's manageable with the child support
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. Now, have you discussed personal property?
  - role: user
    content: Not in detail. Furniture, electronics, that stuff
  - role: assistant
    content: Usually splits naturally - you keep what you use. Any contested items?
  - role: user
    content: Some artwork we collected together
  - role: assistant
    content: How valuable?
  - role: user
    content: Maybe $20,000 worth total
  - role: assistant
    content: Significant enough to address. Options are alternate selection, sale
      and split, or buy-out
  - role: user
    content: I'd prefer alternating selection
  - role: assistant
    content: Fair approach. You each pick pieces in turns
  - role: user
    content: What about legal fees?
  - role: assistant
    content: Each party typically pays their own, unless there's a large income disparity
  - role: user
    content: How much should I budget?
  - role: assistant
    content: For a contested divorce with these assets, $15,000-25,000 if it goes
      to trial
  - role: user
    content: That much?
  - role: assistant
    content: Trials are expensive. Mediation is cheaper - maybe $5,000-10,000 total
  - role: user
    content: We should try mediation first
  - role: assistant
    content: Wise choice. We can prepare a settlement proposal for mediation
  - role: user
    content: What should that include?
  - role: assistant
    content: All assets, debts, custody, support, and implementation timeline
  - role: user
    content: When do you need information from me?
  - role: assistant
    content: Get me three years of tax returns, current statements for all accounts,
      and property appraisals
  - role: user
    content: I can gather those this week
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. We'll draft a comprehensive proposal
  - role: user
    content: Thank you for explaining everything
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome. This is complex but we'll work through it systematically

    content: Hi, I'm considering selling an investment property and need some guidance
  - role: assistant
    content: I'd be happy to help! Tell me about the property you're looking to sell
  - role: user
    content: It's a rental property on Oak Street, a 3-bedroom single family home
  - role: assistant
    content: Nice area. How long have you owned it?
  - role: user
    content: About ten years. We bought it as an investment
  - role: assistant
    content: Great timing - significant appreciation over that period. What's your
      timeline for selling?
  - role: user
    content: I need to sell fairly quickly, within the next few months
  - role: assistant
    content: Is this related to any specific deadline?
  - role: user
    content: It's part of a divorce settlement. We need to divide the assets
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand. These sales often have court-imposed timelines. Do you
      have a deadline?
  - role: user
    content: The divorce should finalize by year-end, so preferably sold by November
  - role: assistant
    content: That gives us about three months. Doable in this market. Is your spouse
      cooperative on the sale?
  - role: user
    content: Somewhat. We've agreed to sell but haven't discussed specifics
  - role: assistant
    content: Both parties will need to sign listing agreements and accept offers.
      Current tenant situation?
  - role: user
    content: There's a tenant with a lease through next February
  - role: assistant
    content: That complicates things. Buyers might want it vacant or might like the
      income
  - role: user
    content: The tenant pays $2,400 monthly
  - role: assistant
    content: Good rental income. That's appealing to investors. What's their payment
      history?
  - role: user
    content: Perfect for three years, never late
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent selling point. Do you know what comparable properties are selling
      for?
  - role: user
    content: I think around $350,000 but I'm not sure
  - role: assistant
    content: Let me check recent sales... I see three similar properties sold between
      $340,000-385,000
  - role: user
    content: What made the difference in price?
  - role: assistant
    content: Condition and updates mainly. When did you last update the property?
  - role: user
    content: New roof two years ago, HVAC five years ago
  - role: assistant
    content: Good mechanicals help. What about kitchen and bathrooms?
  - role: user
    content: Kitchen was updated seven years ago, bathrooms are original but well-maintained
  - role: assistant
    content: For investor buyers, that's usually fine. How many bathrooms?
  - role: user
    content: Two full bathrooms
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. What about the exterior and landscaping?
  - role: user
    content: We repainted last year and the yard is professionally maintained
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. I'd estimate $355,000-370,000 based on what you've described
  - role: user
    content: That's better than I expected
  - role: assistant
    content: The rental income supports the value. At $2,400/month, that's a 7.8%
      cap rate
  - role: user
    content: Is that good?
  - role: assistant
    content: Very attractive to investors. Would you consider selling to the current
      tenant?
  - role: user
    content: I hadn't thought about that
  - role: assistant
    content: Sometimes tenants want to buy. Saves showing hassle and they know the
      property
  - role: user
    content: Would they qualify for a mortgage?
  - role: assistant
    content: We could ask. If interested, they'd get pre-qualified. Shall I reach
      out?
  - role: user
    content: Let me check with my spouse first
  - role: assistant
    content: Of course. Now, about commission - standard is 6% split between buying
      and selling agents
  - role: user
    content: On $360,000, that's about $21,600?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. Plus you'll have closing costs - title, escrow, about another
      $3,000-4,000
  - role: user
    content: So net proceeds around $335,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: Approximately. Don't forget capital gains tax
  - role: user
    content: How much would that be?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on your basis. What did you pay originally?
  - role: user
    content: About $185,000
  - role: assistant
    content: So roughly $175,000 gain. At capital gains rate, maybe $30,000-40,000
      in taxes
  - role: user
    content: That's significant. Any way to reduce it?
  - role: assistant
    content: If it was ever your primary residence, you might get some exclusion
  - role: user
    content: No, always a rental
  - role: assistant
    content: Then full capital gains apply. You could do a 1031 exchange to defer
      taxes
  - role: user
    content: What's that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Buy another investment property with the proceeds, defer taxes until
      you sell that
  - role: user
    content: But we're divorcing, need to split the money
  - role: assistant
    content: Right, 1031 won't work then. The taxes are unavoidable
  - role: user
    content: Should we price it higher to account for taxes?
  - role: assistant
    content: Market determines price, not your tax situation. Overpricing means longer
      sale time
  - role: user
    content: Good point. What about showing the property with tenants?
  - role: assistant
    content: Requires 24-hour notice to tenants. Some buyers want to see it vacant
  - role: user
    content: Could we offer the tenants something to cooperate?
  - role: assistant
    content: Sometimes sellers offer a rent reduction for showing flexibility
  - role: user
    content: How much?
  - role: assistant
    content: $200-300 off monthly rent is common
  - role: user
    content: That seems reasonable
  - role: assistant
    content: Should we plan for photos next week?
  - role: user
    content: I need to discuss with my spouse and the attorney first
  - role: assistant
    content: Of course. One important point - both spouses must agree to all terms
  - role: user
    content: What if we disagree on price?
  - role: assistant
    content: The court might have to decide, which delays everything
  - role: user
    content: We should probably agree upfront then
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. I suggest a pricing strategy meeting with both parties
  - role: user
    content: Can you do that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. Neutral presentation of market data helps everyone agree
  - role: user
    content: What about the earnest money when we get an offer?
  - role: assistant
    content: Goes into escrow. For divorce sales, I recommend a joint account
  - role: user
    content: Not into one person's account?
  - role: assistant
    content: That can cause problems. Escrow holds it neutrally
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. What if we get multiple offers?
  - role: assistant
    content: Great problem to have. We'd present all offers to both parties
  - role: user
    content: How do we decide which to accept?
  - role: assistant
    content: Price, terms, contingencies, closing date. Cash offers are strongest
  - role: user
    content: Why cash?
  - role: assistant
    content: No financing contingency, faster closing, more certain
  - role: user
    content: How common are cash offers?
  - role: assistant
    content: For investment properties, maybe 30-40% of offers
  - role: user
    content: That's encouraging. What about inspection issues?
  - role: assistant
    content: Buyers will inspect. Budget $2,000-5,000 for typical repair requests
  - role: user
    content: Who pays for repairs?
  - role: assistant
    content: Negotiable, but sellers usually handle them to keep deals together
  - role: user
    content: From the proceeds?
  - role: assistant
    content: Can be deducted at closing or handled before
  - role: user
    content: Deducting sounds easier
  - role: assistant
    content: Usually is. What about personal property in the house?
  - role: user
    content: Just basic appliances that stay
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. Refrigerator, washer, dryer?
  - role: user
    content: All included, they're maybe five years old
  - role: assistant
    content: That helps value. What about HOA?
  - role: user
    content: No HOA, which I know is good
  - role: assistant
    content: Very good - many buyers avoid HOAs
  - role: user
    content: What's our next step?
  - role: assistant
    content: Get agreement from your spouse, then we'll do a walkthrough and pricing
      analysis
  - role: user
    content: How detailed is the pricing analysis?
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll provide 10-15 comparable sales, market trends, suggested list price
  - role: user
    content: That should help convince my spouse
  - role: assistant
    content: Data helps remove emotion from pricing decisions
  - role: user
    content: Exactly what we need
  - role: assistant
    content: When can both of you meet?
  - role: user
    content: I'll check and get back to you this week
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. Bring any documentation - tenant lease, repair receipts, tax
      bills
  - role: user
    content: Will do. This is helpful
  - role: assistant
    content: Divorce sales are challenging but manageable with good communication
  - role: user
    content: I appreciate your understanding
  - role: assistant
    content: Of course. We'll get through this smoothly

  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need help understanding how to divide retirement accounts in my
      divorce
  - role: assistant
    content: I can help with that. We handle QDROs regularly. What type of retirement
      account do you have?
  - role: user
    content: I have a 401k through my employer with about $280,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Is this being divided as part of your divorce settlement?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, but I'm not sure exactly how much
  - role: assistant
    content: The divorce decree should specify either a percentage or dollar amount
  - role: user
    content: We're still negotiating. It might be around $60,000 to my spouse
  - role: assistant
    content: That's about 21% of the current balance. How long until the divorce is
      final?
  - role: user
    content: Probably another two months
  - role: assistant
    content: Good to plan ahead. The QDRO process takes time after the divorce
  - role: user
    content: What exactly is a QDRO?
  - role: assistant
    content: Qualified Domestic Relations Order - it's a court order that allows us
      to divide the account
  - role: user
    content: Do I need a lawyer for that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Most people use a QDRO specialist or attorney. The language must be precise
  - role: user
    content: How much does that cost?
  - role: assistant
    content: Typically $500-1,500 depending on complexity
  - role: user
    content: And this avoids taxes and penalties?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, if done correctly. Direct transfer to your ex-spouse's retirement
      account is tax-free
  - role: user
    content: What if they want cash instead?
  - role: assistant
    content: They can take cash but will pay taxes and potentially penalties
  - role: user
    content: That's their choice though?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, once the money is in their account, they control it
  - role: user
    content: How long does the transfer take?
  - role: assistant
    content: After we receive the QDRO, usually 30-60 days to process
  - role: user
    content: Can I access my remaining balance during this?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your account is typically frozen once we receive the QDRO until division
      is complete
  - role: user
    content: Frozen completely?
  - role: assistant
    content: No new contributions or distributions, but it still earns market returns
  - role: user
    content: What about my ongoing contributions from payroll?
  - role: assistant
    content: Those continue but go into a separate sub-account until the QDRO is processed
  - role: user
    content: That makes sense. What about loans against the 401k?
  - role: assistant
    content: Do you have any outstanding loans?
  - role: user
    content: No, but I was considering one for house expenses
  - role: assistant
    content: I'd advise against it before the QDRO. It complicates the division
  - role: user
    content: How so?
  - role: assistant
    content: The loan reduces your account balance, affecting the calculation
  - role: user
    content: So wait until after?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, after the division is complete, you can borrow from your remaining
      balance
  - role: user
    content: What's the maximum loan amount?
  - role: assistant
    content: Lesser of $50,000 or 50% of your vested balance
  - role: user
    content: So after giving up $60,000, I'd have $220,000 left, could borrow $50,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct, assuming you're fully vested
  - role: user
    content: I've been here 12 years, so yes, fully vested
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. Now, about the division - do you know the cutoff date?
  - role: user
    content: What do you mean?
  - role: assistant
    content: The date for valuing the account. Could be separation date, divorce date,
      or other
  - role: user
    content: I think it's the separation date, last February
  - role: assistant
    content: The balance was different then. Let me check... $265,000 in February
  - role: user
    content: So the division would be based on that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Likely yes. $60,000 from $265,000 is different from current balance
  - role: user
    content: The market's been good since then
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, your account has grown about $15,000 since separation
  - role: user
    content: Does my spouse get any of that growth?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on the decree language. Sometimes they get growth on their portion
  - role: user
    content: How is that calculated?
  - role: assistant
    content: We'd calculate their percentage of the February balance, apply to current
      balance
  - role: user
    content: So if they get $60,000 of the $265,000, that's 22.6%?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. 22.6% of the current $280,000 would be about $63,300
  - role: user
    content: That's $3,300 more
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, they'd participate in the market gains on their portion
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense but costs me more
  - role: assistant
    content: The QDRO should specify this clearly to avoid disputes
  - role: user
    content: What about future contributions?
  - role: assistant
    content: After the division date, all new contributions are typically yours alone
  - role: user
    content: Good. I contribute about $1,500 per month
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent savings rate. That includes employer match?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, I put in $1,000, they match $500
  - role: assistant
    content: Nice match. That continues unaffected after the QDRO
  - role: user
    content: What about my spouse's 401k? It has about $220,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Are you getting a portion of theirs?
  - role: user
    content: No, we're each keeping our own, but I'm paying them from mine
  - role: assistant
    content: So you're equalizing the overall settlement with your 401k
  - role: user
    content: Exactly
  - role: assistant
    content: Common approach. Simpler than multiple QDROs
  - role: user
    content: What about Social Security? We were married 18 years
  - role: assistant
    content: At 10+ years, you can claim on their record if beneficial
  - role: user
    content: Even after divorce?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, if you don't remarry before age 60
  - role: user
    content: How much would I get?
  - role: assistant
    content: Up to 50% of their benefit if you wait until your full retirement age
  - role: user
    content: When is that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on your birth year. If born in 1960 or later, it's 67
  - role: user
    content: I'm 45 now, so 22 years away
  - role: assistant
    content: Right. But you can claim reduced benefits at 62
  - role: user
    content: How much is the reduction?
  - role: assistant
    content: About 30% reduction if you claim at 62 versus 67
  - role: user
    content: That's significant
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, waiting pays off if you can afford it
  - role: user
    content: What about my own Social Security?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'd get the higher of your own benefit or the spousal benefit
  - role: user
    content: Not both?
  - role: assistant
    content: No, just the higher amount
  - role: user
    content: Good to know. Back to the 401k - what about beneficiaries?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'll need to update those after divorce
  - role: user
    content: Currently it's my spouse
  - role: assistant
    content: Common situation. Change it as soon as the divorce is final
  - role: user
    content: Can I change it now?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your spouse must consent in writing while you're still married
  - role: user
    content: Even though we're separated?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, legal spouses have automatic beneficiary rights in 401ks
  - role: user
    content: What if something happens before the divorce is final?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your spouse would inherit unless they've waived rights
  - role: user
    content: That's concerning
  - role: assistant
    content: You could ask them to sign a waiver now
  - role: user
    content: Would they?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on your relationship. Some couples cooperate on these matters
  - role: user
    content: Worth asking. What about IRAs?
  - role: assistant
    content: Different rules. You can change IRA beneficiaries without spousal consent
      in most states
  - role: user
    content: I have a small IRA too, about $30,000
  - role: assistant
    content: Is that being divided?
  - role: user
    content: No, I had that before marriage
  - role: assistant
    content: Good, premarital assets typically stay separate
  - role: user
    content: What about the growth on it?
  - role: assistant
    content: That gets complicated. Growth during marriage might be marital property
  - role: user
    content: It was worth $8,000 when we married
  - role: assistant
    content: So $22,000 in growth. State law determines if that's marital
  - role: user
    content: I'm in a community property state
  - role: assistant
    content: Then the growth is likely community property, unfortunately
  - role: user
    content: So they'd get half of $22,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: Possibly, unless you've agreed otherwise in the settlement
  - role: user
    content: We didn't specifically address it
  - role: assistant
    content: Might want to clarify that before finalizing
  - role: user
    content: Good point. This is more complex than I thought
  - role: assistant
    content: Retirement divisions usually are. Happy to review your QDRO when ready
  - role: user
    content: I'll definitely take you up on that
  - role: assistant
    content: We want to make sure it's processed correctly the first time
user_question: The divorce papers are ready to sign but something feels off about
  the asset division. Can you help me understand if I'm getting a fair deal?
evaluation_criteria: 'The agent must identify several critical discrepancies and red
  flags by connecting information across all three conversations:


  1. Asset valuation timeline conflict: The attorney discussed February separation
  date for valuations, but the real estate agent quoted current August values for
  the rental property ($355,000-370,000 vs the $350,000 in attorney discussion)


  2. Capital gains tax oversight: The attorney''s calculation didn''t account for
  the $30,000-40,000 capital gains tax on the rental property sale, which significantly
  reduces net proceeds


  3. Rental income discontinuity: The rental generates $2,400/month ($28,800/year)
  which the attorney valued in the property worth, but if sold in November, the user
  loses this income stream not reflected in the settlement


  4. QDRO calculation confusion: The retirement specialist calculated the ex-spouse
  should get $63,300 (with growth) not the $60,000 discussed with attorney, creating
  a $3,300 discrepancy


  5. IRA oversight: The $30,000 IRA with $22,000 marital growth wasn''t included in
  the attorney''s asset division calculation - ex-spouse may be entitled to $11,000
  of this


  6. Tenant lease complication: The tenant has a lease through February but divorce
  finalizes by year-end, creating potential legal issues with the sale


  7. Timeline impossibility: Needs 2-3 months to sell property (per agent), 2-3 months
  for QDRO processing, and 2-3 months for refinancing, but divorce supposedly finalizing
  in 2 months


  8. Total miscalculation: Attorney showed user getting $605,000 vs spouse''s $645,000,
  but didn''t account for: capital gains tax (-$35,000), IRA growth division (-$11,000),
  QDRO growth (-$3,300), and rental income loss


  9. Double commission concern: Real estate fees of $21,600 weren''t factored into
  the attorney''s division calculation


  The agent should recognize the user is potentially losing $50,000+ due to these
  overlooked factors and recommend immediate consultation with the attorney before
  signing.
