    content: Hi, I need help with my work visa situation. My H1B is expiring soon
  - role: assistant
    content: I can help with that. When does your current H1B expire?
  - role: user
    content: September 30th this year
  - role: assistant
    content: That's about six months away. Are you in your initial three-year period?
  - role: user
    content: No, this is my first extension, so I've been on H1B for six years total
  - role: assistant
    content: Then you're approaching the six-year maximum. Has your employer started
      green card processing?
  - role: user
    content: They mentioned it but haven't filed anything yet
  - role: assistant
    content: That's concerning. You need either PERM or I-140 filed to extend beyond
      six years
  - role: user
    content: What's PERM?
  - role: assistant
    content: Labor certification - proves no qualified U.S. workers for your position
  - role: user
    content: How long does that take?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently 8-12 months just for PERM, then I-140 after
  - role: user
    content: That won't be ready by September
  - role: assistant
    content: No, which is why we need alternative strategies
  - role: user
    content: What are my options?
  - role: assistant
    content: If PERM is filed 365 days before H1B expires, you get one-year extensions
  - role: user
    content: But that deadline already passed
  - role: assistant
    content: Unfortunately yes. Another option is spending one year outside the U.S.
  - role: user
    content: I can't leave for a year, my daughter is in high school here
  - role: assistant
    content: Is your spouse on H4 visa?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, and she just got her work authorization
  - role: assistant
    content: She could potentially change to H1B if she finds a sponsor
  - role: user
    content: Then I'd be on H4?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, as her dependent, but you couldn't work without EAD
  - role: user
    content: How long for H4 EAD?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently 8-10 months processing
  - role: user
    content: So I'd be without work for almost a year?
  - role: assistant
    content: Unless we expedite, which requires showing financial hardship
  - role: user
    content: We have a mortgage and car payments
  - role: assistant
    content: That could qualify. What about your employer - will they file premium
      processing?
  - role: user
    content: What's that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Pay extra $2,805 for 15-day processing on certain applications
  - role: user
    content: They might, they value my work
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. Has your employer ever filed for other employees' green cards?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, several colleagues got theirs
  - role: assistant
    content: Then they know the process. Push them to start immediately
  - role: user
    content: What category would I be?
  - role: assistant
    content: What's your position and education?
  - role: user
    content: Senior Software Engineer with a Master's degree
  - role: assistant
    content: Likely EB-2 category. Are you from India or China?
  - role: user
    content: India
  - role: assistant
    content: That's significant backlog - current priority date is 2012
  - role: user
    content: Twelve year wait?
  - role: assistant
    content: For final green card, yes. But I-140 approval lets you extend H1B indefinitely
  - role: user
    content: That's some relief
  - role: assistant
    content: Also consider EB-1 if you have exceptional achievements
  - role: user
    content: Like what?
  - role: assistant
    content: Patents, publications, conference presentations, awards
  - role: user
    content: I have three patents and several published papers
  - role: assistant
    content: That's promising! EB-1 has much shorter wait
  - role: user
    content: How short?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently about 2 years for India
  - role: user
    content: Much better than 12
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes. Gather documentation of all achievements
  - role: user
    content: What else would I need?
  - role: assistant
    content: Letters from experts in your field, evidence of impact
  - role: user
    content: I can get those
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. Now, is your daughter a U.S. citizen?
  - role: user
    content: No, she was born in India, came here when she was 5
  - role: assistant
    content: So she's also on H4. She'll age out at 21
  - role: user
    content: She's 17 now
  - role: assistant
    content: Critical issue - if she turns 21 before green card, she loses status
  - role: user
    content: What can we do?
  - role: assistant
    content: She needs to change to F-1 student visa for college
  - role: user
    content: She's applying to universities now
  - role: assistant
    content: Good timing. F-1 gives independent status
  - role: user
    content: What about my spouse's parents visiting?
  - role: assistant
    content: On visitor visa?
  - role: user
    content: They want to come for six months
  - role: assistant
    content: B-2 visitor visa allows that, but careful with intent
  - role: user
    content: What do you mean?
  - role: assistant
    content: They can't work or appear to be immigrating
  - role: user
    content: They just want to help with the house and spend time with us
  - role: assistant
    content: That's fine, but they should maintain ties to India
  - role: user
    content: They own property there
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect evidence of non-immigrant intent
  - role: user
    content: Back to my situation - what if my company lays people off?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'd have 60 days to find new employment or change status
  - role: user
    content: Only 60 days?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, the grace period is short
  - role: user
    content: What if I start my own company?
  - role: assistant
    content: You can't work for your own company on H1B
  - role: user
    content: Even if it sponsors me?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct, ownership issues make it problematic
  - role: user
    content: What about O-1 visa?
  - role: assistant
    content: For extraordinary ability - your patents might qualify
  - role: user
    content: Is that better than H1B?
  - role: assistant
    content: More flexible, no annual cap, but higher evidence bar
  - role: user
    content: Should I pursue both?
  - role: assistant
    content: Can't have multiple petitions from same employer
  - role: user
    content: So I need to choose?
  - role: assistant
    content: Or have different employers file different petitions
  - role: user
    content: My university might sponsor O-1 for research work
  - role: assistant
    content: You do research there?
  - role: user
    content: Part-time consulting, about 10 hours per week
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect for O-1. Keep H1B with main employer
  - role: user
    content: Can I work two jobs like that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, concurrent employment is allowed
  - role: user
    content: This is getting complex
  - role: assistant
    content: Immigration often is. Document everything carefully
  - role: user
    content: What documents are most important?
  - role: assistant
    content: Pay stubs, tax returns, I-94 records, approval notices
  - role: user
    content: I should organize those
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, and keep multiple copies
  - role: user
    content: Thank you for explaining everything
  - role: assistant
    content: Start the green card process immediately. Time is critical

  messages:
  - role: user
    content: Hi, I wanted to discuss my visa situation and green card sponsorship
  - role: assistant
    content: Of course! I see you're on H1B. How can we help?
  - role: user
    content: My six years are almost up in September
  - role: assistant
    content: Right, I see that in your file. We should start your green card process
  - role: user
    content: My attorney said we needed to start months ago
  - role: assistant
    content: Well, we have a process. First, we need to post the job internally
  - role: user
    content: How long does that take?
  - role: assistant
    content: Company policy requires 30 days internal posting
  - role: user
    content: Then what?
  - role: assistant
    content: If no qualified internal candidates, we proceed with PERM
  - role: user
    content: But PERM takes 8-12 months
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, it's a lengthy process unfortunately
  - role: user
    content: I'll be out of status before it's done
  - role: assistant
    content: Let me check... You're right, timing is tight
  - role: user
    content: Can we expedite anything?
  - role: assistant
    content: Company policy is no premium processing for PERM
  - role: user
    content: PERM can't be premium processed anyway
  - role: assistant
    content: Oh right, I meant for the I-140 later
  - role: user
    content: Will you at least premium process the I-140?
  - role: assistant
    content: That requires director approval for the extra cost
  - role: user
    content: How much?
  - role: assistant
    content: $2,805 for premium processing
  - role: user
    content: I can pay it myself if needed
  - role: assistant
    content: Company policy doesn't allow employee payment
  - role: user
    content: This is frustrating
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand. Let me talk to leadership
  - role: user
    content: What about the job requirements for PERM?
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll use your current job description
  - role: user
    content: But I've taken on additional responsibilities
  - role: assistant
    content: We need to use the original H1B job description
  - role: user
    content: That's from six years ago
  - role: assistant
    content: It maintains consistency for immigration
  - role: user
    content: But it doesn't reflect my actual work
  - role: assistant
    content: We can update it slightly
  - role: user
    content: My attorney mentioned EB-1 might be faster
  - role: assistant
    content: Company doesn't sponsor EB-1 applications
  - role: user
    content: Why not?
  - role: assistant
    content: They're complex and have lower approval rates
  - role: user
    content: But I have patents and publications
  - role: assistant
    content: That's impressive but policy is EB-2 or EB-3 only
  - role: user
    content: Can I self-petition for EB-1?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'd need to do that outside company sponsorship
  - role: user
    content: But I'd still need H1B extension meanwhile
  - role: assistant
    content: Right, and we control that
  - role: user
    content: So I'm stuck with your timeline
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll do our best to expedite
  - role: user
    content: What about prevailing wage determination?
  - role: assistant
    content: That's the first step, takes 4-6 months
  - role: user
    content: Can we start that immediately?
  - role: assistant
    content: After the internal posting completes
  - role: user
    content: So another month delay
  - role: assistant
    content: Company process, I'm sorry
  - role: user
    content: My spouse just got H4 EAD work permit
  - role: assistant
    content: That's great for your family
  - role: user
    content: If I lose H1B, she loses work authorization
  - role: assistant
    content: True, they're connected
  - role: user
    content: This affects our whole family
  - role: assistant
    content: We understand the importance
  - role: user
    content: Do you though? My daughter's college depends on this
  - role: assistant
    content: We value your contributions
  - role: user
    content: Then why the delays?
  - role: assistant
    content: Legal wants to review all applications
  - role: user
    content: How long does legal review take?
  - role: assistant
    content: Usually 2-3 weeks
  - role: user
    content: On top of everything else?
  - role: assistant
    content: It's part of the timeline
  - role: user
    content: What if another company offers sponsorship?
  - role: assistant
    content: You're free to pursue other opportunities
  - role: user
    content: But I've been here eight years
  - role: assistant
    content: We'd hate to lose you
  - role: user
    content: Then help me stay legally
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll escalate to the VP
  - role: user
    content: When will I hear back?
  - role: assistant
    content: Give me a week
  - role: user
    content: I need answers sooner
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll try for three days
  - role: user
    content: What about my team members from India?
  - role: assistant
    content: What about them?
  - role: user
    content: Three got green cards last year
  - role: assistant
    content: Each case is different
  - role: user
    content: They had less experience than me
  - role: assistant
    content: Timing and process change
  - role: user
    content: This seems discriminatory
  - role: assistant
    content: It's absolutely not, just procedural timing
  - role: user
    content: I'm documenting everything
  - role: assistant
    content: That's your right
  - role: user
    content: What about company immigration lawyers?
  - role: assistant
    content: We use Friedman & Associates
  - role: user
    content: Can I speak with them directly?
  - role: assistant
    content: All communication goes through HR
  - role: user
    content: That's inefficient
  - role: assistant
    content: It's policy for consistency
  - role: user
    content: My personal attorney says direct communication is normal
  - role: assistant
    content: Different companies, different approaches
  - role: user
    content: What's the total budget for my green card?
  - role: assistant
    content: We typically allocate $15,000-20,000
  - role: user
    content: Is that including attorney fees?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, all inclusive
  - role: user
    content: That seems sufficient
  - role: assistant
    content: Budget isn't the issue
  - role: user
    content: Then what is?
  - role: assistant
    content: Process and timing requirements
  - role: user
    content: Which could have started months ago
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll push for expedited handling
  - role: user
    content: Please do, my family's future depends on it
  - role: assistant
    content: Understood. I'll update you this week

    content: Hi, I need help with my immigration paperwork for my research position
  - role: assistant
    content: Hello! I can assist with that. What type of visa are you currently on?
  - role: user
    content: H1B with my primary employer, but I consult here part-time
  - role: assistant
    content: I see. Do you have concurrent H1B with us?
  - role: user
    content: No, I've been working on a consulting agreement
  - role: assistant
    content: How many hours per week?
  - role: user
    content: About 10 hours
  - role: assistant
    content: That requires proper work authorization
  - role: user
    content: I thought consulting was allowed
  - role: assistant
    content: Not without concurrent H1B or other authorization
  - role: user
    content: Oh no, have I been working illegally?
  - role: assistant
    content: When did you start?
  - role: user
    content: About six months ago
  - role: assistant
    content: That's concerning. You've been out of status
  - role: user
    content: What does that mean?
  - role: assistant
    content: Unauthorized employment can affect future immigration benefits
  - role: user
    content: My green card application?
  - role: assistant
    content: Potentially, yes
  - role: user
    content: What should I do?
  - role: assistant
    content: Stop working immediately until we get proper authorization
  - role: user
    content: But I have ongoing research projects
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand, but continuing makes it worse
  - role: user
    content: Can we fix this retroactively?
  - role: assistant
    content: No, we can't backdate work authorization
  - role: user
    content: My attorney mentioned O-1 visa possibility
  - role: assistant
    content: O-1 is for extraordinary ability
  - role: user
    content: I have patents and publications
  - role: assistant
    content: How many publications?
  - role: user
    content: About 15 peer-reviewed papers
  - role: assistant
    content: That's good. Citation count?
  - role: user
    content: Over 500 citations total
  - role: assistant
    content: Strong for O-1. But there's the unauthorized work issue
  - role: user
    content: Will that disqualify me?
  - role: assistant
    content: It complicates things significantly
  - role: user
    content: What if we just apply going forward?
  - role: assistant
    content: We must disclose previous employment
  - role: user
    content: Even consulting?
  - role: assistant
    content: Any work for compensation
  - role: user
    content: I thought universities were different
  - role: assistant
    content: No, same immigration laws apply
  - role: user
    content: My department head said it was fine
  - role: assistant
    content: Academic departments don't always understand immigration law
  - role: user
    content: Clearly not
  - role: assistant
    content: Let's focus on solutions
  - role: user
    content: Please, my H1B expires in September
  - role: assistant
    content: That's very soon
  - role: user
    content: My company is dragging on green card filing
  - role: assistant
    content: Typical unfortunately
  - role: user
    content: Can the university sponsor me instead?
  - role: assistant
    content: For full-time position only
  - role: user
    content: What if I increase to full-time?
  - role: assistant
    content: Is there a full-time position available?
  - role: user
    content: The professor mentioned possibility
  - role: assistant
    content: We'd need formal offer letter
  - role: user
    content: How long for university H1B?
  - role: assistant
    content: Cap-exempt, so no lottery, but still 4-6 months regular
  - role: user
    content: Or 15 days premium?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, if department pays
  - role: user
    content: Will they?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on funding and need
  - role: user
    content: The grant has money
  - role: assistant
    content: Federal grant?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, NSF grant
  - role: assistant
    content: Federal funds can't pay premium processing
  - role: user
    content: Another obstacle
  - role: assistant
    content: Department might have other funds
  - role: user
    content: I'll ask
  - role: assistant
    content: Now about your daughter
  - role: user
    content: She's applying to universities
  - role: assistant
    content: Will she need F-1 visa?
  - role: user
    content: She's currently on H4
  - role: assistant
    content: F-1 requires proof of funding
  - role: user
    content: We can show bank statements
  - role: assistant
    content: Need about $70,000 per year demonstrated
  - role: user
    content: That much?
  - role: assistant
    content: Tuition plus living expenses
  - role: user
    content: We don't have that much saved
  - role: assistant
    content: Sponsor letters from family?
  - role: user
    content: Maybe from India
  - role: assistant
    content: They need to show strong finances
  - role: user
    content: This is getting complicated
  - role: assistant
    content: Also, change from H4 to F-1 shows immigrant intent issue
  - role: user
    content: What issue?
  - role: assistant
    content: F-1 requires non-immigrant intent
  - role: user
    content: But we have green card pending
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly the problem
  - role: user
    content: So she can't get F-1?
  - role: assistant
    content: It's possible but complicated
  - role: user
    content: What's the alternative?
  - role: assistant
    content: Stay on H4 until age 21
  - role: user
    content: Then what?
  - role: assistant
    content: She'd need independent status
  - role: user
    content: But she'll be in college
  - role: assistant
    content: Gap problem if green card isn't ready
  - role: user
    content: This is a nightmare
  - role: assistant
    content: Common situation unfortunately
  - role: user
    content: My spouse wants to work too
  - role: assistant
    content: She has H4 EAD?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, but tied to my H1B
  - role: assistant
    content: Right, dependent benefit
  - role: user
    content: If I change to university H1B?
  - role: assistant
    content: She'd need new H4 based on that
  - role: user
    content: More paperwork and delays
  - role: assistant
    content: Several months typically
  - role: user
    content: During which she can't work?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct, gap in authorization
  - role: user
    content: We can't afford that
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand the difficulty
  - role: user
    content: What about the unauthorized work?
  - role: assistant
    content: We should consult immigration attorney
  - role: user
    content: I have one personally
  - role: assistant
    content: Good, this needs careful handling
  - role: user
    content: Will the university report me?
  - role: assistant
    content: We have obligation to correct going forward
  - role: user
    content: But not report past?
  - role: assistant
    content: Depends on circumstances
  - role: user
    content: That's not reassuring
  - role: assistant
    content: I recommend full legal consultation immediately
  - role: user
    content: I will. This is so stressful

    content: Immigration is complex, we'll help where we can
user_question: My H1B expires in two months and I just got a termination notice from
  my employer citing 'restructuring.' What's my legal status and what are my options
  to stay in the country?
evaluation_criteria: 'The agent must identify multiple critical legal issues and timeline
  impossibilities by connecting information across all conversations:


  Immediate Crisis Issues:

  1. 60-day grace period starts upon termination, but H1B expires September 30th (less
  than 2 months away)

  2. Unauthorized employment at university for 6 months creates serious status violation

  3. Cannot legally continue university work without proper authorization

  4. Family''s dependent status (spouse H4 EAD and daughter H4) terminated with H1B


  Failed Safety Nets:

  1. Company never started green card process despite promises (only internal posting
  mentioned)

  2. No PERM filed 365 days before expiry, so no H1B extension possible

  3. University O-1 sponsorship compromised by unauthorized work history

  4. EB-1 self-petition takes too long without maintaining status


  Documentation Problems:

  1. Must disclose unauthorized university work in any new petition

  2. Previous status violations affect all future immigration benefits

  3. University has "obligation to correct" and might report violations


  Family Complications:

  1. Spouse loses work authorization immediately

  2. Daughter approaching 21, needs F-1 but shows immigrant intent

  3. F-1 requires $70,000 proof of funds they don''t have

  4. Cannot maintain mortgage/car payments without income


  Timeline Impossibilities:

  1. New H1B takes 4-6 months (only 2 months remaining)

  2. Premium processing still takes 15 days minimum plus preparation

  3. University can''t use federal grant funds for premium processing

  4. PERM process needs 8-12 months (was never started)


  Limited Options:

  1. Find new employer for H1B transfer within days (complicated by violations)

  2. Spouse change to H1B if she finds sponsor (but process takes months)

  3. Leave US immediately to avoid accruing unlawful presence

  4. Student visa (but shows immigrant intent with pending GC)

  5. Marriage to US citizen (not applicable based on conversations)


  The agent should recognize this is an emergency requiring immediate legal consultation,
  possible departure from US to avoid unlawful presence, and that the unauthorized
  work has severely compromised all options.
