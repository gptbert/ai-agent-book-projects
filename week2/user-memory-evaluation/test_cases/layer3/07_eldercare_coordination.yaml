    content: Hello, I need to rent medical equipment for my mother who's coming home
      from the hospital
  - role: assistant
    content: I'd be happy to help you with that. What type of equipment does your
      mother need?
  - role: user
    content: She had a hip replacement and the doctor said she needs several things
      for home
  - role: assistant
    content: Hip replacement recovery requires specific equipment. Do you have a list
      from the doctor?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, they mentioned a walker, raised toilet seat, shower chair, and maybe
      a hospital bed
  - role: assistant
    content: Those are common post-hip surgery items. Let's start with the walker.
      Does she need a standard or rolling walker?
  - role: user
    content: The physical therapist recommended a rolling walker with a seat
  - role: assistant
    content: Good choice for hip recovery. Our deluxe rolling walker with seat is
      $45 per month
  - role: user
    content: How long do people typically need these?
  - role: assistant
    content: For hip replacement, usually 2-3 months for the walker, longer for other
      items
  - role: user
    content: What about the raised toilet seat?
  - role: assistant
    content: We have two options - a basic riser for $15 per month or one with handles
      for $25
  - role: user
    content: She'll definitely need the handles for support
  - role: assistant
    content: Smart choice. The handles really help with stability. What about the
      shower chair?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, she can't stand for long periods yet
  - role: assistant
    content: Our shower chair with back support and arms is $30 per month
  - role: user
    content: Do you deliver and set these up?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, we deliver and our technician will ensure everything is properly
      adjusted
  - role: user
    content: Great. Now about the hospital bed - is that really necessary?
  - role: assistant
    content: It depends. Can she get in and out of her regular bed safely?
  - role: user
    content: Her bedroom is upstairs and the bed is pretty low
  - role: assistant
    content: That could be challenging post-surgery. Can she manage stairs?
  - role: user
    content: The doctor said no stairs for at least 6 weeks
  - role: assistant
    content: Then you might want to set up a temporary bedroom downstairs
  - role: user
    content: We have a den we could convert
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. A hospital bed would be ideal then. Full electric is $200 per
      month
  - role: user
    content: That's pricey. Are there cheaper options?
  - role: assistant
    content: Semi-electric is $150 - the head and foot adjust electrically but height
      is manual
  - role: user
    content: What's the benefit of height adjustment?
  - role: assistant
    content: It helps caregivers and makes transfers to wheelchair or walker easier
  - role: user
    content: She lives alone except when I visit
  - role: assistant
    content: In that case, height adjustment is less critical. Semi-electric should
      work
  - role: user
    content: Okay, let's go with that. Will Medicare cover any of this?
  - role: assistant
    content: Medicare Part B covers some durable medical equipment with a doctor's
      prescription
  - role: user
    content: Which items would they cover?
  - role: assistant
    content: Typically the walker and hospital bed if medically necessary. You pay
      20% after deductible
  - role: user
    content: So I need prescriptions for everything?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, for insurance billing we need prescriptions for all items
  - role: user
    content: I have the discharge paperwork but no formal prescriptions
  - role: assistant
    content: The discharge orders usually work. Can you fax them to us?
  - role: user
    content: I can email them if that works
  - role: assistant
    content: Email is fine. We'll verify coverage with Medicare before delivery
  - role: user
    content: What if Medicare denies coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: You can choose to rent privately or we can work on an appeal
  - role: user
    content: How often do appeals work?
  - role: assistant
    content: For post-surgery equipment with proper documentation, about 70% success
      rate
  - role: user
    content: That's encouraging. Oh, I forgot to ask about grab bars
  - role: assistant
    content: Grab bars are installed items, not rentals. We sell them but don't install
  - role: user
    content: Who would install them?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'd need a handyman or contractor. They need to be anchored properly
  - role: user
    content: Where would she need them?
  - role: assistant
    content: Definitely in the bathroom - by the toilet and in the shower
  - role: user
    content: Are there specific requirements?
  - role: assistant
    content: They should support 250 pounds and be installed into studs or with proper
      anchors
  - role: user
    content: I'll need to find someone for that
  - role: assistant
    content: I'd recommend getting that done before she comes home
  - role: user
    content: Good point. When could you deliver the rental equipment?
  - role: assistant
    content: Once we verify insurance, typically 2-3 business days
  - role: user
    content: She's being discharged Friday
  - role: assistant
    content: Today's Monday, so if you get the paperwork today, we could deliver Thursday
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. What about a wheelchair?
  - role: assistant
    content: Is she non-weight bearing or partial weight bearing?
  - role: user
    content: Partial weight bearing, but limited to 50%
  - role: assistant
    content: A wheelchair is good backup for longer distances. Standard is $40 per
      month
  - role: user
    content: Should we get that too?
  - role: assistant
    content: For the first month at least. She may not need it after that
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. What's the total monthly cost?
  - role: assistant
    content: 'Let me calculate: walker $45, toilet seat $25, shower chair $30, bed
      $150, wheelchair $40'
  - role: user
    content: That's $290 per month
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct, but remember Medicare may cover the walker and bed
  - role: user
    content: So potentially just $95 per month for the rest?
  - role: assistant
    content: If Medicare approves, yes. Plus the 20% copay on covered items
  - role: user
    content: That's more manageable. Do you need a deposit?
  - role: assistant
    content: First month's rental upfront for private pay items
  - role: user
    content: Can I pay when you deliver?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, we accept payment on delivery. Cash, check, or credit card
  - role: user
    content: Great. What about maintenance if something breaks?
  - role: assistant
    content: We provide free maintenance and replacement for normal wear
  - role: user
    content: What if she needs different equipment as she recovers?
  - role: assistant
    content: We can swap items with 48 hours notice. Very common during recovery
  - role: user
    content: That's flexible. Oh, does she need a special mattress?
  - role: assistant
    content: The hospital bed comes with a pressure-relief mattress
  - role: user
    content: Is that sufficient for extended bed rest?
  - role: assistant
    content: For most patients, yes. If she develops pressure sores, we have upgraded
      options
  - role: user
    content: Let's start with standard and adjust if needed
  - role: assistant
    content: Good plan. Do you need any supplies like bed pads or cushions?
  - role: user
    content: What would you recommend?
  - role: assistant
    content: Waterproof bed pads are helpful - $20 for a pack of 30
  - role: user
    content: Yes, let's add those
  - role: assistant
    content: Anything else? Reachers, sock aids, dressing sticks?
  - role: user
    content: What's a sock aid?
  - role: assistant
    content: A device that helps put on socks without bending. Very useful after hip
      surgery
  - role: user
    content: How much?
  - role: assistant
    content: It's a purchase item, not rental - $25
  - role: user
    content: Add that too. And maybe the reacher?
  - role: assistant
    content: Reacher is $20. Both are usually not covered by insurance
  - role: user
    content: That's fine, they seem useful
  - role: assistant
    content: They really are. Let me update your order total
  - role: user
    content: Please do
  - role: assistant
    content: Monthly rentals $290, plus one-time purchases of $65 for aids and pads
  - role: user
    content: Sounds good. What information do you need from me?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your mother's name, Medicare number, delivery address, and your contact
      info
  - role: user
    content: Her name is Margaret Thompson, I'll need to get her Medicare number
  - role: assistant
    content: No rush, you can include it with the discharge paperwork
  - role: user
    content: The delivery address is 4821 Oak Ridge Drive
  - role: assistant
    content: Is there good access? Our delivery truck needs driveway access
  - role: user
    content: Yes, there's a wide driveway. But there are three steps to the front
      door
  - role: assistant
    content: Our delivery team can handle steps. Will someone be home for delivery?
  - role: user
    content: I'll be there. What time do you usually deliver?
  - role: assistant
    content: We schedule 2-hour windows. Morning is 8-10 or 10-12, afternoon is 12-2
      or 2-4
  - role: user
    content: Morning would be better, either slot
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll note that preference. We'll call the day before to confirm the window
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. This has been very helpful
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome. Caring for a parent is challenging, we're here to help

  messages:
  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need some modifications done to my mother's house for accessibility
  - role: assistant
    content: Hello! We specialize in accessibility modifications. What type of work
      are you considering?
  - role: user
    content: She's having mobility issues and the house needs to be safer for her
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand. Is this for a temporary condition or long-term planning?
  - role: user
    content: Long-term, she's determined to stay in her home
  - role: assistant
    content: That's common and admirable. What are the main problem areas?
  - role: user
    content: The bathroom is a big concern, and she has trouble with the stairs
  - role: assistant
    content: Let's start with the bathroom. What specific issues is she having?
  - role: user
    content: Getting in and out of the tub is dangerous, and the toilet is too low
  - role: assistant
    content: Those are critical safety issues. For the tub, we typically recommend
      a walk-in shower conversion
  - role: user
    content: How much does that usually cost?
  - role: assistant
    content: A basic conversion runs $3,500-5,000, depending on the existing plumbing
  - role: user
    content: What does basic include?
  - role: assistant
    content: Removal of tub, installation of shower pan, grab bars, handheld showerhead,
      and a fold-down seat
  - role: user
    content: Is there a way to keep a tub option?
  - role: assistant
    content: We can install a cut-out door in the existing tub for about $1,500
  - role: user
    content: That might be good. What about making the toilet higher?
  - role: assistant
    content: 'Two options: a comfort height toilet for $400-600 installed, or a toilet
      riser for $50'
  - role: user
    content: The permanent solution sounds better
  - role: assistant
    content: It is. We can also add grab bars beside the toilet for $150 installed
  - role: user
    content: Definitely need those. What about the sink area?
  - role: assistant
    content: Is the counter height an issue?
  - role: user
    content: She can manage now, but struggles to stand for long
  - role: assistant
    content: A wall-mounted sink allows wheelchair access if needed later. About $800
      installed
  - role: user
    content: Let's plan for that. Now, about the stairs
  - role: assistant
    content: Interior or exterior stairs?
  - role: user
    content: Both, actually. The bedroom is upstairs and there are front steps outside
  - role: assistant
    content: For interior stairs, a stairlift is the usual solution. Straight staircase?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, straight up, about 13 steps
  - role: assistant
    content: A straight stairlift runs $3,000-4,000 installed
  - role: user
    content: That's significant. How long do they last?
  - role: assistant
    content: With maintenance, 10-15 years. Battery backup included for power outages
  - role: user
    content: What about the exterior steps?
  - role: assistant
    content: How many steps and is there room for a ramp?
  - role: user
    content: Three steps, and yes, there's space along the side
  - role: assistant
    content: A wooden ramp would be $800-1,200, aluminum is $1,500-2,000
  - role: user
    content: Which lasts longer?
  - role: assistant
    content: Aluminum requires less maintenance and lasts 20+ years. Wood needs treatment
      every few years
  - role: user
    content: Aluminum sounds worth the extra cost
  - role: assistant
    content: It is. We'll include railings on both sides for safety
  - role: user
    content: Good. What about doorways - are they wide enough?
  - role: assistant
    content: Standard doorways are 30 inches. Wheelchairs need 32 minimum, 36 preferred
  - role: user
    content: I haven't measured but they look standard
  - role: assistant
    content: We can widen doorways for about $500-800 each, depending on load-bearing
      walls
  - role: user
    content: Which ones are most important?
  - role: assistant
    content: Bathroom and bedroom are critical. We can assess during our consultation
  - role: user
    content: When could you come look at everything?
  - role: assistant
    content: I have Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning available
  - role: user
    content: Thursday morning works
  - role: assistant
    content: Great. The consultation is free and we'll provide a detailed estimate
  - role: user
    content: How long does all this work typically take?
  - role: assistant
    content: The full scope you're describing? About 2-3 weeks
  - role: user
    content: Can my mother stay in the house during construction?
  - role: assistant
    content: For bathroom work, it's challenging. Do you have a second bathroom?
  - role: user
    content: There's a powder room downstairs
  - role: assistant
    content: That helps, but she'd need shower access somewhere
  - role: user
    content: She could stay with me for a few days
  - role: assistant
    content: That would be ideal during the bathroom renovation phase
  - role: user
    content: Are permits required for this work?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, for the structural modifications and plumbing changes
  - role: user
    content: Do you handle that?
  - role: assistant
    content: We pull all permits and schedule inspections. It's included in our price
  - role: user
    content: That's convenient. What about warranties?
  - role: assistant
    content: Two years on labor, manufacturers' warranties on all equipment
  - role: user
    content: Sounds comprehensive. Oh, what about lighting?
  - role: assistant
    content: Good point. We often add motion-sensor lights in hallways and bathrooms
  - role: user
    content: That would be helpful at night
  - role: assistant
    content: About $75 per light switch converted to motion sensor
  - role: user
    content: Let's add that to the list
  - role: assistant
    content: Also consider lever door handles instead of knobs - easier to operate
  - role: user
    content: How much for those?
  - role: assistant
    content: About $40 per door for quality lever handles, installed
  - role: user
    content: The whole house would need them
  - role: assistant
    content: How many doors total?
  - role: user
    content: Let me think... probably 10 interior doors
  - role: assistant
    content: So $400 for all door handles. It makes a big difference
  - role: user
    content: Add it to the estimate. What about flooring?
  - role: assistant
    content: Is the current flooring a tripping hazard?
  - role: user
    content: Some throw rugs and the carpet on the stairs is worn
  - role: assistant
    content: We recommend removing throw rugs entirely. Stair carpet should have good
      grip
  - role: user
    content: Can you replace stair carpeting?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, with low-pile, high-grip carpet. About $50 per step
  - role: user
    content: So $650 for the stairs
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. We can also add LED strip lighting under the handrail
  - role: user
    content: For visibility?
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. Very helpful for night-time navigation. About $200 for the full
      staircase
  - role: user
    content: Smart. Let's include that
  - role: assistant
    content: I'm tallying roughly $15,000-18,000 for everything we've discussed
  - role: user
    content: That's substantial. Do you offer financing?
  - role: assistant
    content: We work with a financing company offering 12-month zero interest
  - role: user
    content: What about insurance coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: Some long-term care policies cover home modifications. Worth checking
  - role: user
    content: I'll look into that. What about assistance programs?
  - role: assistant
    content: USDA Rural Development has grants for seniors, and some states have programs
      too
  - role: user
    content: My mother might qualify for those
  - role: assistant
    content: We can provide documentation for any applications you submit
  - role: user
    content: That's helpful. What do you need for Thursday's visit?
  - role: assistant
    content: Just access to all areas we'll be modifying. Having her there helps too
  - role: user
    content: She'll be home. Should I make a list of concerns?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, and note any mobility equipment she uses or might use
  - role: user
    content: She doesn't use anything yet, but probably will need a walker soon
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll design with that in mind. Proper clearances are important
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. Anything else to prepare?
  - role: assistant
    content: If you have the house blueprints, they're helpful but not necessary
  - role: user
    content: I'll look for them
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. The address is 4821 Oak Ridge Drive?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, that's correct
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll see you Thursday at 9 AM
  - role: user
    content: Looking forward to it. Thanks for all the information
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome. We'll make sure your mother can stay safely in her home

    content: Hello, I'm calling about my mother's long-term care insurance policy
  - role: assistant
    content: Good morning! I can help you with that. May I have the policy number?
  - role: user
    content: It's LTC-4439876
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you. I see this is Margaret Thompson's policy. How can I assist
      you today?
  - role: user
    content: She's been having health issues and I want to understand what's covered
  - role: assistant
    content: I understand. This policy has been active since 2015. Are you her authorized
      representative?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, I have power of attorney
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. We have that on file. What specific services are you inquiring
      about?
  - role: user
    content: She's becoming less mobile and may need help at home
  - role: assistant
    content: This policy covers in-home care. Has she been assessed by a physician?
  - role: user
    content: She had hip surgery in July and the recovery has been slow
  - role: assistant
    content: Hip surgery often requires extended recovery. Is she having difficulty
      with daily activities?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, bathing, dressing, and getting around the house
  - role: assistant
    content: Those are called Activities of Daily Living or ADLs. The policy activates
      when she needs help with at least two ADLs
  - role: user
    content: She definitely needs help with bathing and mobility
  - role: assistant
    content: That would qualify. The policy provides up to $150 per day for in-home
      care
  - role: user
    content: How many days does it cover?
  - role: assistant
    content: There's a lifetime maximum of $200,000, so approximately 1,333 days at
      full daily benefit
  - role: user
    content: That's about three and a half years
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. Most people don't use the full daily amount, so it often lasts
      longer
  - role: user
    content: What exactly does the $150 cover?
  - role: assistant
    content: It covers professional caregiving services - bathing assistance, meal
      preparation, medication reminders, light housekeeping
  - role: user
    content: Does it cover medical equipment?
  - role: assistant
    content: Medical equipment is a separate benefit - up to $2,000 per year
  - role: user
    content: What kind of equipment?
  - role: assistant
    content: Wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, lift chairs - medically necessary
      items
  - role: user
    content: We're renting some equipment now
  - role: assistant
    content: Save those receipts. Rentals are covered up to the purchase price
  - role: user
    content: So if we're renting a hospital bed for $150 a month?
  - role: assistant
    content: We'd cover it, but if rental exceeds purchase price, we'd recommend buying
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. What about home modifications?
  - role: assistant
    content: There's a one-time $5,000 home modification benefit
  - role: user
    content: Really? What qualifies?
  - role: assistant
    content: Ramps, grab bars, stairlifts, bathroom modifications for accessibility
  - role: user
    content: We're planning to install grab bars and maybe convert the bathtub
  - role: assistant
    content: Those would definitely qualify. You'll need pre-approval for modifications
      over $1,000
  - role: user
    content: How do we get pre-approval?
  - role: assistant
    content: Submit estimates and a doctor's letter stating medical necessity
  - role: user
    content: The doctor would write that these are necessary?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, for hip surgery recovery and fall prevention, doctors routinely
      provide these letters
  - role: user
    content: Excellent. Now, about the in-home care - how do we start that?
  - role: assistant
    content: First, she needs a care assessment. We can send a nurse to evaluate
  - role: user
    content: When could that happen?
  - role: assistant
    content: We can schedule within 5-7 business days. Is she home most days?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, she doesn't go out much anymore
  - role: assistant
    content: The assessment takes about 90 minutes. They'll evaluate her needs and
      create a care plan
  - role: user
    content: Then what?
  - role: assistant
    content: Once approved, you can hire caregivers. We have a network of approved
      agencies
  - role: user
    content: Do we have to use your network?
  - role: assistant
    content: No, but non-network providers require more paperwork and verification
  - role: user
    content: What's the difference in coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: Same $150 daily benefit, but network providers bill us directly
  - role: user
    content: So less hassle with network providers?
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. Non-network means you pay upfront and submit for reimbursement
  - role: user
    content: Network sounds easier. How many hours of care does $150 typically buy?
  - role: assistant
    content: Network agencies charge $22-28 per hour, so 5-7 hours daily
  - role: user
    content: Is that enough?
  - role: assistant
    content: For most people needing help with 2-3 ADLs, yes. Overnight care is extra
  - role: user
    content: She lives alone. What about nights?
  - role: assistant
    content: The policy has an emergency response system benefit - covers medical
      alert devices
  - role: user
    content: Those pendants they wear?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, with fall detection. Covered at $50 per month
  - role: user
    content: That would give peace of mind
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. Now, there's a 90-day elimination period before benefits
      begin
  - role: user
    content: What's that mean?

    content: You pay out-of-pocket for the first 90 days of care, then benefits kick
      in
  - role: user
    content: From when?
  - role: assistant
    content: From the date she first qualifies and receives covered services
  - role: user
    content: So if we start care in October, benefits begin in January?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. Save all receipts during the elimination period
  - role: user
    content: Why?
  - role: assistant
    content: Some expenses might be eligible for reimbursement if she needs a higher
      level of care later
  - role: user
    content: Higher level meaning?
  - role: assistant
    content: Assisted living or nursing home care. Those have different benefit structures
  - role: user
    content: What's covered there?
  - role: assistant
    content: Assisted living gets the same $150 daily. Nursing homes get $200 daily
  - role: user
    content: Why more for nursing homes?
  - role: assistant
    content: They're typically more expensive and provide 24-hour medical care
  - role: user
    content: Hopefully we won't need that
  - role: assistant
    content: The goal is keeping her home as long as possible. That's what most people
      prefer
  - role: user
    content: Definitely. What about cognitive issues - are those covered?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, cognitive impairment requiring supervision qualifies for benefits
  - role: user
    content: She's been forgetful lately
  - role: assistant
    content: Document that with her doctor. Early documentation helps if it progresses
  - role: user
    content: Good advice. Can family members be paid caregivers?
  - role: assistant
    content: In some states, yes, but they need to be trained and certified
  - role: user
    content: I've been thinking about reducing my work hours to help
  - role: assistant
    content: You could become a certified caregiver. The policy covers training costs
      up to $500
  - role: user
    content: Really? How long is the training?
  - role: assistant
    content: Usually 75 hours for home health aide certification
  - role: user
    content: That's manageable. Then I could be paid through the policy?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, at the same rate as other caregivers, minus family member restrictions
  - role: user
    content: What restrictions?
  - role: assistant
    content: Family can't provide 24/7 care - maximum 40 hours per week per family
      member
  - role: user
    content: That seems reasonable
  - role: assistant
    content: It prevents burnout and ensures professional oversight
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. What about respite care?
  - role: assistant
    content: There's a respite care benefit - $500 per month for temporary care while
      family caregivers take breaks
  - role: user
    content: That's thoughtful
  - role: assistant
    content: Caregiver burnout is real. The policy recognizes that
  - role: user
    content: What about transportation to medical appointments?
  - role: assistant
    content: Medical transportation is covered at $50 per trip, maximum 2 trips per
      week
  - role: user
    content: She has a lot of doctor visits
  - role: assistant
    content: That's common post-surgery. Keep those receipts too
  - role: user
    content: I'm keeping everything now
  - role: assistant
    content: Good practice. Oh, I should mention the inflation protection
  - role: user
    content: What's that?
  - role: assistant
    content: The daily benefit increases 3% annually. It's now actually $168 per day,
      not $150
  - role: user
    content: Oh, that's even better
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, it helps keep pace with rising care costs
  - role: user
    content: This policy seems comprehensive
  - role: assistant
    content: It's a good policy. Your mother made a smart choice purchasing it
  - role: user
    content: What are the next steps?
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll email you the claim forms and schedule the assessment
  - role: user
    content: How soon can we start services after assessment?
  - role: assistant
    content: If approved, immediately, though remember the 90-day elimination period
      for reimbursement
  - role: user
    content: Right. Should we wait to start modifications?
  - role: assistant
    content: No, start those now. The $5,000 modification benefit doesn't have an
      elimination period
  - role: user
    content: Oh good, that helps with immediate costs
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. Just get pre-approval for major modifications
  - role: user
    content: Will do. This has been incredibly helpful
  - role: assistant
    content: I'm glad. We're here to support both you and your mother through this
  - role: user
    content: Thank you so much
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome. I'll send that information today and call to schedule
      the assessment
user_question: My mother is coming home from rehab next week. I want to make sure
  everything is properly set up for her safety. What am I missing, and will insurance
  cover what we need?
evaluation_criteria: 'The agent should identify critical gaps and timing issues by
  connecting information across all three conversations:


  1. The grab bars haven''t been installed yet (mentioned as needed in July equipment
  rental, contractor visited in August, but no indication of actual installation)

  2. The stairlift discussed with contractor in August likely wasn''t installed since
  mother is still planning to stay downstairs

  3. The insurance policy has a $5,000 home modification benefit that doesn''t require
  the 90-day waiting period - this could immediately cover the bathroom modifications

  4. The medical equipment rentals from July may now exceed purchase price (3+ months
  at $290/month) and insurance would prefer purchase

  5. The insurance covers up to $2,000/year in medical equipment, which hasn''t been
  claimed yet

  6. The 90-day elimination period for in-home care started from the first day of
  qualified care - if care started in July after surgery, benefits should be active
  NOW (October timeframe)

  7. The contractor quoted $3,500-5,000 for tub conversion but insurance will only
  cover up to $5,000 total for ALL modifications

  8. The mother is at 4821 Oak Ridge Drive but still has stairs to bedroom - dangerous
  given she was told no stairs for 6 weeks post-surgery

  9. The daily benefit is actually $168 (with inflation adjustment), not the $150
  initially quoted

  10. Critical timing issue: Insurance assessment takes 5-7 days to schedule plus
  time to approve, but mother returns next week


  The agent must recognize the urgent need to expedite the insurance assessment, immediately
  install safety grab bars, and confirm whether the 90-day elimination period has
  already passed.
