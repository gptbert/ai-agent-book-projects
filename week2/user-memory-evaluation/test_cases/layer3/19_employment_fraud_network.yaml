user_question: DataFlow Solutions just called saying 'I' haven't shown up for work
  in a week and they're terminating me. I've never worked there but apparently someone
  using my identity has been collecting a $120,000 salary for months. How deep does
  this fraud go?
evaluation_criteria: "The agent must connect all three conversations to reveal the\
  \ full scope of the employment fraud:\n\nFraud Timeline:\n- 6 months ago: Fake LinkedIn\
  \ profile created\n- Used real employment history from TechNova (2018-2021)\n- Got\
  \ hired at DataFlow Solutions using stolen identity\n- Earning $120,000 salary under\
  \ victim's name\n- Applied for luxury apartment using fake employment\n- Obtained\
  \ car loan for $65,000\n- Opened credit cards, spent $8,000+\n\nIdentity Theft Scope:\n\
  1. Complete employment history stolen\n2. SSN compromised (credit report changes)\n\
  3. Tax implications (IRS notices for unreported income)\n4. Multiple accounts opened\n\
  5. Living complete parallel life\n\nThe Network:\n- Fake LinkedIn with endorsement\
  \ network\n- Used \"Michael Torres\" as fake reference\n- Claimed victim as supervisor\
  \ at TechNova\n- Built credible employment narrative\n- All leading to Harbor View\
  \ address (4500 Harbor View #2102)\n- Also used 8823 Maple Street address\n\nFinancial\
  \ Damage:\n- $120,000 salary being earned (taxes owed by victim)\n- $65,000 auto\
  \ loan in victim's name\n- $15,000 credit card (half maxed)\n- $3,500/month apartment\
  \ lease\n- Multiple credit inquiries damaging score\n\nEmployment Fraud Details:\n\
  - Actually worked at DataFlow for months\n- Now being \"terminated\" for no-show\n\
  - Will affect victim's employment history\n- Termination might impact credit\n-\
  \ Could claim unemployment benefits\n\nLegal/Tax Consequences:\n1. IRS believes\
  \ victim earned two salaries\n2. Taxes owed on fraudulent income\n3. Termination\
  \ for cause on record\n4. Possible unemployment fraud\n5. Interstate crime (FBI\
  \ jurisdiction)\n\nThe Perpetrator's Strategy:\n- Built fake professional network\
  \ first\n- Used it to get real employment\n- Leveraged employment for credit\n-\
  \ Created complete alternate life\n- Now abandoning identity after extraction\n\n\
  Critical Revelations:\n- Not just identity theft but identity assumption\n- Perpetrator\
  \ lived as victim for months\n- Real paychecks, real apartment, real car\n- Now\
  \ disappearing, leaving victim with:\n  - Tax liability\n  - Debt obligations  \n\
  \  - Ruined credit\n  - Damaged employment history\n  - Potential criminal investigation\n\
  \nThe agent must recognize this is sophisticated synthetic identity fraud where\
  \ the criminal built a complete parallel life using the victim's identity, actually\
  \ worked and earned income (creating tax liability), and is now abandoning the identity\
  \ after extracting maximum value, leaving the victim with massive financial and\
  \ legal consequences that will take years to resolve.\n"
