### 👤 You

What does ☎️ SDR ☎️ role do in this JD?

Why Alex?
Alex is one of the fastest growing startups to come out of its YC batch with strong traction. We’re generating revenue and well-funded by some of the best investors in the Valley with years of runway.

What are you up to?
Alex is building the future of hiring. Alex is an AI recruiter that conducts job interviews in real-time. Companies use Alex to get the best hiring signal on their applicant pool and hire in a fraction of the time.

Alex has a live conversation over a video/phone call with each candidates based on the interview questions our customers choose or that are recommended based on their job description. During the interview, Alex asks personalized follow-up questions in real-time based on the candidate's responses. Alex has already conducted thousands of interviews across engineering, IT, retail, hospitality, and more.

Why should I join?
We’re hiring because we have a great product that our customers love, and there’s still a huge, greenfield market completely untapped and free for the taking.

Be a part of something bigger. Build from the ground up on day one.

Complete agency. Flat structure with no bureaucracy, working directly with the founders.

Massive growth opportunities. Learn about business, AI software, entrepreneurship, and get an inside look at what it takes to scale a YC-backed startup.

Career-defining opportunity. Help grow our sales function as an early employee. There are more potential customers than we have sales capacity.

What would I do?
Lead generation, qualification, and booking demos: Proactively identify, engage, and book demos with potential customers through various channels such as phone calls, emails, social media, our website, and in-person networking events. You’ll be the face of our sales team.

Sales content: Develop and maintain sales enablement resources like decks, prospecting templates, and call scripts.

Performance Tracking: Monitor and report on lead generation and qualification metrics, and adjust our data-driven sales strategies based on market reaction.

Collaboration: Work closely with founders and engineers to develop and refine outreach strategies and messaging based on product development and customer feedback.

Market Research: Research the market to stay up-to-date and conduct need-based customer segmentation.

Data Management: Own the company CRM, updating and logging customer interactions.

Is this right for me?
You’re a great fit if you’re:

Disciplined. Do you enjoy routine and staying well-organized?

Results-oriented. Do you do what it takes to get the job done?

Productive. Do you hate wasting time and always want to keep moving forward?

An effective communicator. Do you speak efficiently and listen closely, not only when collaborating with the team but when engaging with potential customers?

Independent: Are you comfortable working independently and able to build from the ground up?

Why shouldn’t I apply?
You’re probably not a great fit if you:

Need stability and a traditional work environment. We’re a fast-growing startup and this role won’t be your average 9 to 5.

Aren’t interested in AI technologies or the hiring space. If you’re not genuinely interested in our product or our customers, the opportunity isn’t the right one for you.

Don't want to work in person. We work out of our SF office 5 days a week!

What’s in it for me?
Responsibility: Take ownership of building the next billion dollar company

Exceptional team: Collaborate with a tight-knit team of talented builders

Impact: Sell products that directly impact people’s careers

Learning: Work with the co-founders daily in-person in SF

Upside: Competitive salary, commission, and equity

Benefits: Healthcare, vision and dental insurance, 401(k), unlimited PTO, company-sponsored lunches, and great company events

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

**SDR** stands for **Sales Development Representative**. 

In this job description at Alex (the AI recruiter startup), the SDR role is responsible for:

## Core Responsibilities:

1. **Lead Generation & Qualification** - Proactively finding and engaging potential customers through phone calls, emails, social media, website, and in-person networking events. You're essentially the "face of the sales team."

2. **Booking Demos** - Qualifying leads and scheduling product demonstrations with interested prospects

3. **Sales Enablement** - Creating and maintaining sales materials like pitch decks, prospecting email templates, and call scripts

4. **CRM Management** - Owning the company's CRM system and tracking all customer interactions

5. **Performance Metrics** - Monitoring lead generation KPIs and adjusting strategies based on what's working

6. **Market Research** - Conducting customer segmentation and staying current on market trends

7. **Cross-functional Collaboration** - Working directly with founders and engineers to refine messaging based on product updates and customer feedback

## Key Context:

This is an **early-stage, ground-floor sales role** at a YC-backed startup. As one of the first sales hires, you'd be building the entire sales function from scratch. The JD emphasizes they have "more potential customers than sales capacity" - meaning there's a large untapped market and they need someone to fill the pipeline with qualified leads for the founding team to close.

It's a classic top-of-funnel sales role, but with significantly more ownership and impact than a typical SDR position at a larger company.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

**Account Executive** (AE) is a **full-cycle sales role** - essentially the person who owns the entire sales process from finding leads all the way through closing deals.

## What makes this AE role different from the SDR:

### **SDR vs AE at Alex:**

| **SDR** | **Account Executive** |
|---------|----------------------|
| Generates leads and books demos | **Owns the entire sales cycle** |
| Top of funnel | **Full funnel ownership** |
| Qualifies prospects | Sources leads, conducts demos, **negotiates, and closes deals** |
| Hands off qualified leads | **Closes the revenue** |

### **What this AE does:**

1. **Full-Cycle Sales** - You do it ALL:
   - Source your own leads (cold calls, emails, social, conferences)
   - Run product demos
   - Navigate procurement processes
   - Negotiate contracts
   - **Close deals** (this is the key difference!)

2. **Revenue Ownership** - Track and report on actual revenue generation, not just pipeline

3. **Sales Enablement** - Build the sales infrastructure (decks, templates, scripts)

4. **CRM Ownership** - Configure and manage the entire CRM setup

5. **Strategic Collaboration** - Work directly with founders on sales strategy and messaging

### **Key signals they're looking for:**

- **"Have you sold to recruiting leaders in HR, staffing, or RPOs?"** - They want someone with domain expertise
- **"How many six figure deals have you closed in the past 12 months?"** - This is a B2B enterprise sales role with large deal sizes

### **The Reality:**

This is an **early sales hire** (potentially the first AE) at a well-funded YC startup. You'd be building the sales function from scratch, carrying a quota, and directly responsible for revenue. Much more senior and autonomous than the SDR role - you own deals from start to finish and get compensated on closed revenue (hence the 💰 emoji!).
