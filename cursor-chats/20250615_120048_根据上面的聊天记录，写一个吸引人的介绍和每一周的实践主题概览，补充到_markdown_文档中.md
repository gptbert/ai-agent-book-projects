### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Okay, I've reviewed the chat logs. The idea of building a single, evolving agent throughout the course is fantastic! It's much more engaging and practical.

I will now update the `AI Agent实战训练营.md` file to reflect this project-based approach. I'll add an exciting new introduction for the course schedule and detail the hands-on project for each week, transforming the learning plan into a clear, step-by-step guide for building a powerful AI Agent from the ground up.
