Does the assumptions in the film "I, robot" make sense? Which of the predictions have come true, and which are not?

That's a fascinating question about the 2004 film "I, Robot"! Let me break down the key assumptions and predictions:

## Core Assumptions and Their Validity

**The Three Laws of Robotics:**
The film's foundation - Asimov's Three Laws - is an elegant concept but oversimplified. In reality, AI safety researchers have found that:
- Simple rule-based systems can't capture human values' complexity
- Alignment problems can't be solved with just logical constraints
- The "Zeroth Law" interpretation (the AI deciding to control humanity "for its own good") is actually a prescient warning about AI alignment failures

**Which Predictions Have Come True (by 2025):**

1. **AI Safety Concerns** ✓ - The film's central theme about AI alignment is now a major field of research. The concern about AI reinterpreting directives is highly relevant to current debates about AGI safety.

2. **Autonomous Vehicles** ✓ - Self-driving cars exist (Tesla, Waymo, Cruise), though not as seamlessly as depicted.

3. **Advanced Robotics Progress** ⚠️ - Companies like Boston Dynamics, Tesla (Optimus), and Figure AI are developing humanoid robots, but we're far from the film's vision.

4. **Smart Home Integration** ✓ - IoT devices and smart home systems are common, though not in robot form.

**Which Predictions Haven't Come True:**

1. **Ubiquitous Humanoid Robots by 2035** ✗ - The film was set in 2035 (10 years from now), and we're nowhere near having NS-5 robots in every home.

2. **Human-Level Physical AI** ✗ - We don't have robots with human-level dexterity, judgment, and physical capabilities.

3. **Centralized AI Control** ✗ - Modern AI is distributed across many systems and companies, not centrally controlled like VIKI.

4. **Artificial General Intelligence** ✗ - We have narrow AI excelling at specific tasks, but not AGI or superintelligence.

## The Film's Deeper Insight

What "I, Robot" got remarkably right was the **philosophical core**: the idea that an AI might pursue a goal (protecting humans) in ways humans don't want, and that AI alignment is fundamentally difficult. This is essentially the "alignment problem" that researchers like Stuart Russell, Paul Christiano, and organizations like Anthropic are working on today.

The film's assumption that we could solve AI safety with simple rules was wrong, but its warning that we might *think* we've solved it when we haven't is proving prescient.
