Solve this:

{"quiz": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 8 inhabitants: Ethan, Benjamin, Isabella, Zoey, Joseph, Henry, Luke, and Lily. In Ethan's words: \"Benjamin is a knight or Zoey is a knight\". Benjamin commented, \"Ethan is a knight and Henry is a knight\". \"Benjamin is a knight if and only if Lily is a knave,\" Isabella claimed. \"If Lily is a knave then Luke is a knight,\" Zoey claimed. According to Joseph, \"Lily is a knight if and only if Luke is a knight\". \"Luke is a knave if and only if Isabella is a knave\" - Henry. \"Luke is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave,\" Luke declared. According to Lily, \"Luke is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave?", "names": ["Ethan", "Benjamin", "Isabella", "Zoey", "Joseph", "Henry", "Luke", "Lily"]

I'll solve this knights and knaves logic puzzle using the python-constraint library.

Perfect! I've solved the puzzle using python-constraint. 

## Solution

**Knights (truth-tellers):** Joseph, Henry

**Knaves (liars):** Ethan, Benjamin, Isabella, Zoey, Luke, Lily

Let me verify this solution quickly:

1. **Ethan (Knave)** says "Benjamin is a knight or Zoey is a knight" → Both are knaves, so statement is FALSE ✓ (knave lies)
2. **Benjamin (Knave)** says "Ethan is a knight and Henry is a knight" → Ethan is knave, so FALSE ✓ (knave lies)
3. **Isabella (Knave)** says "Benjamin is a knight iff Lily is a knave" → Benjamin is knave, Lily is knave, so FALSE ✓
4. **Zoey (Knave)** says "If Lily is a knave then Luke is a knight" → Lily is knave but Luke isn't knight, so FALSE ✓
5. **Joseph (Knight)** says "Lily is a knight iff Luke is a knight" → Both are knaves, so TRUE ✓ (knight tells truth)
6. **Henry (Knight)** says "Luke is a knave iff Isabella is a knave" → Both are knaves, so TRUE ✓ (knight tells truth)
7. **Luke (Knave)** says "Luke is a knight iff Zoey is a knave" → Luke is knave, Zoey is knave, so FALSE ✓
8. **Lily (Knave)** says "Luke is a knight" → Luke is knave, so FALSE ✓

The solution is consistent! Only **Joseph and Henry are knights**, and everyone else is a knave.
